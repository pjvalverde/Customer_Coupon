# "Will a customer accept the coupon?"

This repository is an introduction to data analysis to explore what is the probability that certain drivers will accept a trip coupon, what would those parameters be.
Once the data was studied, it was found that the following conclusions were reached:


1. Drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had non-kid passengers, and were not widowed and their occupation is farming, fishing or forestry.
2. Drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are over 25
3. Drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and have an income less than 50K.
4. People whose income is less than 50k, is single and it is alone, go to cheaper restaurant less than 3 times a week
5. People whose income is more than 50k, is not alone and go to cheaper restaurant mopre than 3 times a week

We use the following Python libraries:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```
It is possible that other factors such as the temperature of the day or the time of the day, such as going to other places like coffee shops, may have an impact on the probability of accepting the coupon.
